# Welcome to our Projects Webpage
 Author: Gabriel Walbron & Adrien Jacquin

 In this web page you will find all the information about our project made in relation to our virtual reality lessons at Ecole Centrale Nantes.


  
## Project 1 
 The goal of our first project is to implement a .OBJ file loader in order to read 3D object files.
   
 The steps are the following :
   - Parse the file
   - If inclusion of .MTL texture file -> parse .MTL file 
   - Generating the object through OpenGL

### Solution 1 
 The first solution of this project is using C++ and OpenGL library to load and show the 3D object based on an OBJ file. 
 
### Solution 2
 The second solution of this project is using javascript and WebGL library in order to load and show in the browser a 3D object based on an OBJ file.
This solution is actually using WebGL through the babylonjs Library.
